# Patients Registry API (Turing.com hackathon winner 2021)
The first goal for any rare disease is to identify other patients around the world
diagnosed with this disease. There is strength in numbers in their ability to
raise funds, understand the disease better, and attract researchers to work
on the disease. This project enables a newly diagnosed patient to register themselves as a patient of the
disease & to connect with other patients in same category.
